# First Turn Classification
The first turn classification for COMET

## TODO
- [ ] Only use the sense wires in inner layers (e.g. the inner 6 layers).
- [ ] Only use one feature per sense wire (e.g. the probability of a hit is signal, or the first turn probability predicted by a "weak" frontend first turn classifier).
- [ ] Replace the decision tree with a more "powerful" model (e.g. GBDT).
